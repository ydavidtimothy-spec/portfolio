# Deployment Steps: Adding Automation Checklist to Vercel

Since your main portfolio is already connected to Vercel and GitHub, deploying the new checklist page is very simple. We just need to "push" the new files to your GitHub repository.

## The Process
1.  **Git Add**: Stage the modified files (`automation_checklist.html`, `styles.css`, etc.) for upload.
2.  **Git Commit**: Save the snapshot of these changes with a message (e.g., "Add automation checklist page").
3.  **Git Push**: Send the changes to GitHub.
4.  **Vercel Auto-Deploy**: Vercel detects the new code on GitHub and automatically updates your live site.

## Accessing the New Page
Once deployed, your new page will be available at:
`https://[your-domain].com/automation_checklist.html`

## Next Steps (I can do these for you)
I will run the terminal commands to perform steps 1-3. You don't need to do anything manually.
